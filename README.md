# BEW 2.1 - Advanced Web Patterns in Node.js

## Course Description

We've learned a lot about the web; the common conventions and we've mastered authentication and authorization. Now pretty much you can sort through whatever someone asked for. However, there are a few extra features that are quite conventional that you have not gained mastery over yet. Those tricky features can stymie a novice engineer who doesn't know what tools and patterns they have available to them. For example, simple and full text search, uploading files and images, sending emails

For all in class work, you will be using a clone of the pet store starter project called [Proud Pete's Pet Emporium](https://github.com/Product-College-Labs/petes-pets). You must implement ALL the patterns in this class. If you miss class or do not complete the implementation in class, please do the work as homework. At the end of the class, you're pet store must be completely full featured.

### Project Policy

**All projects will require a minimum of 10 commits, and must take place throughout the time allotted for the project's completion, not just at the end**

- **Good Example:** 40+ commits throughout the length of the course, looking for a healthy spattering of commits each week (such as 3-5 per day).
- **Bad Example:** 10 commits on one day during the course and no others. Students who do this will be at severe risk of not receiving credit for the project.
- **Unacceptable Example:** 2 commits the day before a project is due. Students who do this should not expect to pass the class. 

## Evaluation

To pass this course you must meet the following requirements:

- Finish and turn in
  - Pete's Pet Emporium (GitHub & live link)
  - Make Chat (GitHub & live link)
  - One Public Project that uses 3 features above and beyond resourceful routing and auth (this can be an old project that you added these additional features to)
  - One Technical Blog Post (>1000 words)
- More than two no-call-no-shows, or more than four excused absenses will put you at risk of academic probation
